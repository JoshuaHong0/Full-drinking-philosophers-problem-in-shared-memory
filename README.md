# Full-drinking-philosophers-problem-in-shared-memory

Dining Philosophers Problem, introduced by Edsger Dijkstra in 1972, is a classic problem in synchronization. In 1984, Chandy and Misra came up with an elegant solution to this problem. They generalized their solution to arbitrary conflict graphs — not just the 5-node cycle of Dijkstra’s original problem. They call their generalization the “Drinking Philosophers Problem.” 

This program adapts the [Chandy and Misra solution](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1780.1804) to shared memory and solve the full drinking philosophers problem.
